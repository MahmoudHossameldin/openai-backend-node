# Build AI-Powered Apps with OpenAI and Node.js

I created these projects while learning AI powered web development with Node.js on course.

This repo includes multiple projects, in order to run them, clone the repo, install dependencies "npm install", add your OpenAI key to .env file, and run "node %FILENAME.js%" and start interacting through the command line.

- The chat.js includes a chatting app similar to ChatGPT.

- The qa.js file includes an app in which you can answer questions and get answers, the questions are related to content of the xbox.pdf file or this video https://youtu.be/zR_iuq2evXo?si=cG8rODgRgXOx9_Cn

- The search.js file includes an app in which there is a list of movies and the ability to make semantic search of a movie. For instance, searching for "a movie to laugh" should return the movie whose description include "humor" and "Comedic" as first result before the others.

- The functions.js file in which the app utilizes OpenAI's function calling feature which opens the door incredible and unbelievable opportunities by making the AI interact with the outer world!
